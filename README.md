## Features

### For Patients (via WhatsApp / Voice)

| Action | What to say | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Book an appointment** | "I want to book an appointment" or "Book me for Friday at 11am" | AI asks for preferred day/time, checks availability against doctor schedule, creates the appointment, sends confirmation |
| **Reschedule** | "I want to reschedule" or "Can I move my appointment to Monday?" | AI finds the existing appointment, asks for new time, updates both local DB and Google Calendar |
| **Cancel** | "I want to cancel" or "Cancel my appointment" | AI tries to reschedule first; if patient insists, captures the cancellation reason (cost/fear/timing/transport) and cancels |
| **Confirm** | "Confirm" or "Yes I'll be there" | Marks the appointment as confirmed, logs it in the confirmation history |
| **Ask a question** | "What are your hours?" / "How much is a consultation?" / "Where are you located?" | AI answers from the FAQ knowledge base and gently guides toward booking |
| **Emergency** | "I'm in pain" / "Emergency" / "My tooth is bleeding" | Immediate flag to reception with urgent follow-up |

### For the Practice (Reception Dashboard)

- **Live appointment calendar** — FullCalendar week/day/month views with drag-to-reschedule
- **Pre-appointment reminders** — Table of all upcoming appointments with status tracking (Pending → Sent → Confirmed → Cancelled)
- **Patient management** — Patient list with search, creation, medical history
- **Conversation history** — View all WhatsApp and voice conversations per patient
- **Notifications** — Real-time bell with unread count for new bookings, cancellations, flagged patients
- **Analytics** — Booking stats, cancellation breakdown, channel performance
- **Global search** — Find patients, appointments, and conversations from the navbar
- **Morning confirmations** — Automated batch calls + WhatsApp fallback for same-day appointments

### Data Flow: WhatsApp Booking

```
Patient sends "Book me Friday 11am"
  → Twilio webhook POST /webhooks/whatsapp
  → WhatsappController#incoming
  → WhatsappService#handle_incoming
    → AiService#classify_intent (→ intent: "book", entities: {date: "2026-04-17", time: "11:00"})
    → AiService#generate_response (→ conversational reply)
    → handle_booking
      → attempt_booking
        → Check: slot is in the future ✓
        → Check: DoctorSchedule working hours ✓
        → Check: no conflict in Appointment table ✓
        → Appointment.create! (local DB — source of truth)
        → ConfirmationLog.create! (tracks on reminders page)
        → sync_to_google_calendar (best-effort, swallows errors)
        → send_confirmation_template (WhatsApp template via Twilio)
  → TwiML response back to patient
```

---

## Prerequisites

- **Ruby** 3.3.2
- **Node.js** 20+ and npm
- **PostgreSQL** (or Supabase URL)
- **Twilio account** — phone number + WhatsApp Business sandbox or production number
- **Google Cloud project** — Calendar API enabled + service account JSON key
- **Anthropic API key** — for Claude AI
- **ngrok** — for local Twilio webhook development

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dr-leroux-receptionist.git
cd dr-leroux-receptionist

# 2. Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# 3. Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials (see Environment Variables section)

# 5. Create database, run migrations, seed doctor schedule
bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

# 6. Verify seeds
bin/rails runner "puts DoctorSchedule.active.count"
# Should output: 6 (Mon-Sat schedules)

# 7. Run tests
bundle exec rspec
```

### Seeding

The seed file creates the doctor's working hours:
- **Monday–Friday**: 08:00–17:00, lunch break 12:00–13:00
- **Saturday & Sunday**: Closed

These schedules are required for WhatsApp booking to work — `attempt_booking` checks `DoctorSchedule` before creating an appointment.

---

## Running the App

```bash
# Start Rails + Vite dev servers (uses Procfile.dev)
bin/dev

# In a separate terminal, start ngrok for Twilio webhooks:
ngrok http 3000

# Configure Twilio webhooks to your ngrok URL:
#   WhatsApp: POST https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhooks/whatsapp
#   Voice:    POST https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhooks/voice
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The dashboard home page shows today's appointments, pending confirmations, and key stats.

**Navigation:**
- `/` or `/dashboard` — Dashboard home
- `/appointments` — Appointment calendar + list
- `/reminders` — Pre-appointment reminders with status tracking
- `/patients` — Patient list and management
- `/conversations` — WhatsApp + voice conversation history
- `/analytics` — Booking stats and cancellation breakdown
- `/settings` — Office hours, pricing reference, FAQ

## WhatsApp Commands (Patient Guide)

These are natural-language messages patients can send via WhatsApp. The AI understands variations — these are examples, not rigid commands.

### Booking an Appointment

```
Patient: "I'd like to book an appointment"
Bot:     "I'd love to help! What day and time work best for you?"

Patient: "Friday at 11am"
Bot:     "Perfect! I have you booked for Friday, Apr 17 at 11:00 AM.
          You'll receive a confirmation shortly."
```

The bot checks:
1. Is the slot in the future?
2. Is the practice open? (Mon-Fri 8-5, closed Sat & Sun, lunch 12-1)
3. Is the slot available? (no overlapping appointments)

If any check fails, the bot says: *"Sorry — I couldn't lock that slot in. Could you try a different time, or call the practice directly?"*

### Rescheduling

```
Patient: "I need to reschedule my appointment"
Bot:     "Of course! When would you prefer instead?"

Patient: "How about Wednesday at 2pm?"
Bot:     "Done! Your appointment has been moved to Wednesday, Apr 22 at 2:00 PM."
```

### Cancelling

```
Patient: "I want to cancel my appointment"
Bot:     "I understand. Before we cancel, would you like to reschedule
          to a different time instead?"

Patient: "No, just cancel please"
Bot:     "Your appointment has been cancelled. Could I ask what prompted
          the change? This helps us improve."

Patient: "It's too expensive"
Bot:     "I understand. Our consultation is R850 and includes x-rays —
          it's a thorough assessment. We also accept medical aid.
          Would you like to reconsider?"
```

The bot captures the cancellation reason (cost, fear, timing, transport, other) for analytics.

### Confirming

```
Patient: "Confirm"
Bot:     "Great, your appointment is confirmed! See you then."
```

This updates the appointment status to `confirmed` and logs it in the confirmation history.

### Asking Questions (FAQ)

```
Patient: "What are your hours?"
Bot:     "We're open Monday to Friday 8am–5pm. We're closed on
          weekends (Saturday and Sunday)."

Patient: "How much is a consultation?"
Bot:     "A consultation is R850 and includes x-rays. Would you like
          to book one?"

Patient: "Where are you located?"
Bot:     "Dr Chalita le Roux Inc is located in Pretoria. Please call
          or WhatsApp us for exact directions."
```

### Emergencies

```
Patient: "I'm in severe pain"
Bot:     "I'm sorry you're dealing with that. If this is urgent, please
          call the practice directly now so we can assist you as quickly
          as possible."
```

Emergencies are flagged immediately to reception via WhatsApp alert.

│ Cancelled│    │ Rescheduled │────────────────────────┘
└──────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scheduled` | Appointment created, awaiting confirmation |
| `confirmed` | Patient confirmed (via WhatsApp, voice, or dashboard) |
| `completed` | Appointment took place |
| `cancelled` | Patient or practice cancelled (reason captured) |
| `no_show` | Patient didn't show up |
| `rescheduled` | Moved to a new time |

---

## Reminder System

### Automatic Reminders

| Trigger | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Appointment created** | ConfirmationLog created (status: Pending on reminders page) |
| **Morning batch (08:00)** | `MorningConfirmationJob` calls each same-day patient; WhatsApp fallback if no answer |
| **24 hours before** | `AppointmentReminder24hJob` sends WhatsApp reminder template |
| **1 hour before** | `AppointmentReminder1hJob` sends WhatsApp reminder template |

### Manual Reminders (Dashboard)

From the Reminders page (`/reminders`), the receptionist can:
- **Send WhatsApp** — dispatches a reminder template immediately
- **Call** — triggers an outbound voice confirmation
- **Confirm** — marks the appointment as confirmed (one-click)
- **Cancel** — opens the cancellation modal with reason capture

### Status Flow on Reminders Page

```
Pending → Sent → Confirmed
                → No Answer (flagged for follow-up)
                → Cancelled
```

---

## Background Jobs

All jobs run via **Solid Queue** (Rails 8 built-in).

| Job | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `MorningConfirmationJob` | Daily 08:00 | Calls each same-day patient to confirm; falls back to WhatsApp |
| `AppointmentReminder24hJob` | Daily | Sends WhatsApp reminder for tomorrow's appointments |
| `AppointmentReminder1hJob` | Hourly | Sends WhatsApp reminder for appointments in 45-75 min window |

---

### Notes on Environment Variables

- **Google Calendar is optional** — if `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` is not set, appointments are created locally only (they still show on the in-app calendar). Google sync is best-effort.
- **WhatsApp templates** require Twilio approval. Without them, the bot still works for conversation but won't send proactive template messages (confirmations, reminders).
- **ngrok** is only needed for local development with Twilio webhooks.

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run the full test suite
bundle exec rspec

# Run a specific spec file
bundle exec rspec spec/services/whatsapp_service_spec.rb

# Run with verbose output
bundle exec rspec --format documentation

# Build frontend (verify no JS errors)
npx vite build
```

### Test Coverage

| Area | Specs |
|---|---|
| WhatsApp booking flow | 12 examples (new patient, reuse, booking, conflicts, outside hours, fallbacks) |
| Appointment CRUD | 13 examples (create, update, cancel, confirm, calendar data) |
| Reminders | 8 examples (index, scoping, send dispatch, error handling) |
| AI service | Unit tests with mocked Claude responses |
| Models | Validations, scopes, callbacks |

---

## Key Business Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pricing** | Only quote consultation (R850 incl. x-rays) and cleaning (R1,300). Everything else: "needs a consultation first." |
| **Availability** | Never expose full calendar. Ask patient preference first, then match against schedule. |
| **Tone** | Warm, friendly, slightly energetic, reassuring. Education-based approach: educate → reassure → book. |
| **Cancellations** | Always try to reschedule first. If declined, capture the reason (cost/fear/timing/transport/other). |
| **Working hours** | Mon–Fri 08:00–17:00. Closed on weekends (Sat & Sun). Lunch break 12:00–13:00 (Mon–Fri). |
| **Slot duration** | 30 minutes per appointment. |
| **Conversion focus** | Every interaction should naturally guide toward booking a consultation. |
